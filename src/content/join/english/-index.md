**◆ Research Objective: "Uncover the Structure-Function Correlation of Materials to Achieve Material Design"**

If we can understand the "atomic and electronic structure," which primarily determines the material properties, and further understand the "correlation between structure and function," material design becomes possible.  
To date, material development has required great efforts and costs. However, achieving a sustainable carbon-neutral society necessitates more accurate and rapid material development than ever before. Our laboratory aims to **uncover the structure-function correlation** of materials by combining first-principles calculations, atomic-level electron microscopy, spectroscopy, and machine learning to realize **'material design.'**

Specifically, we have studied advanced functional materials such as quantum materials, catalysts, energy materials, and ceramics. However, since our laboratory utilizes first-principles calculations, atomic-level measurements, and machine learning, we can research any material system. We conduct research that **respects individual curiosity**, including exploring new superconductors, ion conductors, designing materials like perovskite solar cell materials, polymers, biomaterials, atomic-level gas-liquid analysis, and challenges related to quantum technology.

**◆ Guidance Policy: "Leaving a milestone in science = Publishing as the first author in science journals"**

Our laboratory belongs to a research institute, and thus consists only of graduate students affiliated with the Department of Materials Science and Engineering in the Graduate School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo. As a result, students joining our lab often transfer from other universities or laboratories upon entering graduate school. After joining the lab, students first learn the basics of quantum chemistry and crystallography, and then acquire skills in programming, theoretical calculations, machine learning, and electron microscopy. Through our research, the member would further develop essential skills for researchers, such as presentations, academic writing, and discussion.

Moving to a new laboratory or university is challenging, for me, the present place is the 7th place for my research life. However, I well understand that there is much to gain by the challenge. All former students have presented at domestic and international conferences and published academic papers as the first author that stand as milestones in science. If significant results are achieved, students may be featured in press releases, appear in newspapers and online, win awards at conferences, or be invited to give lectures. **The Mizoguchi Lab is a place where students take the lead, grow, and thrive.**

Through a deep understanding of materials from the perspective of atoms and electrons, **the Mizoguchi Lab aims to cultivate the next generation of leaders in materials science.**

**◆ We Are Recruiting Graduate Students & JSPS Research Fellows!**

Students in our lab begin new research themes upon entering graduate school and have achieved numerous research accomplishments that will leave a mark in scientific history, even within limited timeframes. No prior knowledge of programming, theoretical calculations, or electron microscopy is required. Almost all former students started without such knowledge and acquired these skills during their research. What is important is **a passion for atoms and electrons**. The Mizoguchi Lab is **seeking students with a strong interest in atoms and electrons**.  
We also welcome applications for [**JSPS Research Fellowships (PD, RPD)**](https://www.jsps.go.jp/j-pd/). The JSPS PD and RPD fellowships offer valuable opportunities for independent and free research. Please utilize our lab as a place to acquire new knowledge and skills and grow into an independent researcher.

**◆ Guidance for Doctoral Studies**

Through research in our laboratory, you will gain advanced skills in simulation, measurement, and machine learning, and deep knowledge for understanding material phenomena at the atomic and electronic level. Additionally, you will develop logical approaches to various challenges and keen insight to identify potential issues before they emerge. In a doctoral program, you can cultivate the ability to discover and solve your unique challenges while deeply exploring your own research interests.

The skills acquired in a doctoral program are valuable in any field, not only in academic research but also in private enterprises and startups. Recently, we have also seen an increase in inquiries from private sector employees interested in obtaining a doctorate. Moreover, the lifestyle of doctoral students has evolved significantly in recent years. Doctoral students in our lab receive support (including financial aid) from JSPS, JST, and the University of Tokyo. The University of Tokyo also provides **<u>similar support for master's students planning to advance to doctoral programs</u>**. Additionally, our lab offers independent support to ensure students can focus on their research activities and develop their skills.

Our lab's doctoral graduates are active in various fields, including universities, research institutes, and private companies. If you have any concerns or questions about pursuing a doctoral degree, feel free to consult with Mizoguchi. Our students begin new research themes upon entering graduate school and have achieved numerous accomplishments that will leave a mark in scientific history, even within limited timeframes.
