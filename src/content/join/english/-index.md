**◆ Research purpose: "Reveal the structure-function relationship of materials to realize materials design"**

Materials design is possible if we can clarify the ``atomic and electronic structure'' that primarily determines the properties of materials, and furthermore understand the ``correlation between structure and function.''

Until now, material development has required a huge amount of time and effort. However, to achieve a sustainable carbon-neutral society, more accurate and rapid material development is essential than ever before. In our laboratory, we aim to realize **material design** by elucidating the correlation between the structure and function of materials, that is, **structure-function correlation**, through a combination of first-principles calculations, atomic resolution electron microscopy, spectroscopy, and machine learning.

Specifically, we have been researching advanced functional materials such as quantum materials, catalysts, energy materials, and ceramics, but since we use first-principles calculations, atomic resolution measurements, and machine learning as research methods, we can research any material system. We respect each individual's curiosity and conduct research, such as searching for new superconductors and ionic conduction bands, designing perovskite solar cell materials, polymer materials, and biomaterials, as well as atomic resolution gas-liquid analysis and the challenge of quantum technology.

**◆ Our policy: "Leave your name in the science history = write a manuscript as the first author"**

Since our laboratory is located at an affiliated research institute, it does not belong to a faculty and is composed only of graduate students in the Department of Materials Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering. Therefore, students in our laboratory have to be moved from other universities and groups when they advance to the graduate school. After joining, the students will first learn the basics of quantum chemistry and crystallography, and then learn how to program, perform theoretical calculations, machine learning, and use an electron microscope. After that, through research, they will acquire presentation, paper writing, and discussion skills that are essential for researchers.

Although it is difficult to change laboratories or universities, there are many benefits to doing so. All students who have been enrolled to date have presented at domestic and international conferences, and become lead authors of academic papers that will go down in science history. If they achieve good results, they will be featured in newspapers and on the web after a press release, and some students will receive awards at academic conferences and be invited to lectures. **The Mizoguchi research group is a laboratory where the students grow and thrive**.

Through a deep understanding of materials from the perspective of atoms and electrons, the Mizoguchi Laboratory aims to develop talent that will lead the future of materials science.

**◆ We are recruiting graduate students and JSPS special researchers!**

Students in our laboratory start new research themes after entering graduate school, and even in a limited period of time, they have produced many research results that will go down in science history. It is not necessary to have prior knowledge of programming, theoretical calculations, or electron microscopes. Almost all of the students who have belonged to us so far started their research without such knowledge and acquired it as they progressed with their research. The important thing is to be interested in atoms and electrons. The Mizoguchi Laboratory is looking for students who love atoms and electrons. We also welcome JSPS Research Fellowship PD/RPD applications (https://www.jsps.go.jp/j-pd/) to be accepted by our laboratory. The JSPS PD/RPD Research Fellowship is a valuable opportunity to conduct independent and free research. Please use our laboratory as a place to acquire new knowledge and skills and grow as an independent researcher. 

**◆Recommendation for doctoral studies (Added May 2024)** 

In light of recent changes in social conditions, we have recently been recommending that students continue on to a doctoral course. Through research in our laboratory, you will not only gain advanced skills in simulation, measurement, and machine learning, but also deep knowledge to understand material phenomena at the atomic and electronic levels. You will also develop logical approaches to various problems and sharp insight to discover problems that have not yet been identified. In the doctoral program, students can develop the ability to find unique problems and open up new paths to solving them while maintaining a deep inquisitive mind about their own research.

Such abilities can be acquired in the doctoral program and are extremely useful in any field, and are required not only in academic research but also in private companies and ventures. In recent years, we have seen an increase in consultations from private companies about obtaining a doctorate. The lifestyles of doctoral students have also changed significantly in recent years. Doctoral students in our laboratory receive support (financial support, etc.) from JSPS, JST, and the University of Tokyo. In particular, the University of Tokyo provides similar support to master's students who plan to proceed to a doctoral program. In addition, our laboratory also provides its own support necessary for students to concentrate on research activities and develop their skills.

To date, more than 40% of students in our laboratory have proceeded to doctoral programs, and the number of consultations about entering a doctoral program has been increasing in recent years. Graduates of our laboratory who have completed their doctoral programs are active in a variety of fields, including universities, research institutes, and private companies. If you have any concerns or questions about entering a doctoral program, please contact Mizoguchi. Students in the laboratory start new research themes after entering graduate school, and even in a limited time, they develop their "power" and produce many research results that will go down in science history.

**◆ How to join the Mizoguchi Laboratory**

This laboratory belongs to the Department of Materials Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo. If you wish to join our laboratory as a graduate student, please take the graduate school entrance exam. For details, please refer to the Department of Materials Engineering's [**Entrance Examination Information Homepage**](https://www.material.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/e/prospective_students/briefing/).
