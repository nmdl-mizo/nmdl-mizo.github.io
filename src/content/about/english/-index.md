##### Our Research Objective = “Paving the way for Materials Design through a deep understanding of chemical bonding ”

<p align="left">Enormous time and effort have been devoted to material development. However, as society continues to change dynamically and rapidly, more accurate and swift material development is now required than ever before. If we can realize material design by understanding the correlation between atomic/electronic structures and functional expression, we can significantly accelerate material development. To achieve such material design, it is essential to elucidate the atomic and electronic structures in the local regions responsible for functional expression, and further understand the mechanisms and laws governing functional expression from the obtained results. The Mizoguchi Laboratory aims to achieve 'Material Design Realization' through research using first-principles calculations, informatics methods, and atomic-resolution measurements (STEM-EELS). <br> The Mizoguchi Laboratory is engaged in the following research themes:

##### Materials Informatics for materials developments and database and code developments　
 <p align="left">
In recent years, data science has been attracting attention as the fourth paradigm, and "Materials Informatics," which uses data science in material research, is advancing globally and rapidly. In our group, we are tackling the following research subjects by constructing artificial intelligence (AI) based on the informatics science.<br>
1) Paving the way for materials design with generative AI and large-scale language models (LLMs)<br>
2) Multimodal materials characterization using machine learning<br>
3) Materials developments through inverse design<br>
4) Materials discovery and synthesis using AI Agents<br>
5) Discovery of new materials and new physical properties using data-driven methods<br>
6) Informatics approaches for lattice defect <br>
For example, using our methods, it is possible to complete calculations that would normally take 22 years in just 3 hours. Additionally, by utilizing AI technology, we have succeeded in gaining new insights that even specialized researchers could not obtain before.

###### High Precision and High Throughput Simulation of Lattice Defect Formation and Dynamics in Semiconductors and Two-Dimensional Materials　
<p align="left"> With the dramatic improvement in computing speed in recent years, it is becoming possible to perform electronic state calculations for systems consisting of hundreds of atoms using parameter-free first-principles methods. Additionally, the environment for "Universal" machine learning potentials has improved, making it possible to optimize the structure of models with thousands of atoms with high precision on a laptop-level computer. Our laboratory is utilizing such cutting-edge simulation methods to conduct research on lattice defects, dopants, surfaces, and interfaces in advanced materials such as semiconductors, ceramics, two-dimensional compounds, and layered compounds, focusing on their formation behavior and dynamics.

##### Simulation of Core-loss Spectrum and Developping "Spectrum Informatics" approaches 
<p align="left">  Electron energy-loss near-edge structure (ELNES) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) are both core-level excitation spectra that occur when core electrons transition to unoccupied orbitals. ELNES and XANES are powerful material analysis techniques with high spatial resolution, time resolution, and detection sensitivity. However, interpreting these spectra requires theoretical calculations based on first-principles methods. Our laboratory is working on developing theoretical computational methods for ELNES/XANES and is currently engaged in research aimed at establishing comprehensive computational methods for all structures, all elements, and all absorption edges. Futhermore, based on the spectrum database through the simulations, we have attempted to extract new insight and physics from the spectrum via machine learning.

<p align="left"> By combining spherical aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), it is possible to obtain atomic-resolution information on the atomic and electronic structures of materials.

##### Material Design of Glasses, Liquids, and Soft Materials Utilizing Atomic-Resolution Measurements　　
<p align="left"> Glasses, liquids, gases, and soft materials are widely used in daily life and industrial activities. The properties of these materials are often determined by local atomic structure disorder and dynamic behavior changes, but local structure analysis is challenging due to their complexity. Our laboratory is developing methods to analyze glasses, liquids, gases, and soft materials with high spatial resolution using transmission electron microscopy and is applying these methods to actual materials. We have successfully observed the behavior of individual atoms in liquids in real space, observed dynamic behavior of gas molecules with high spatial resolution, and quantitatively elucidated high-temperature phase separation phenomena in glasses in real space and real-time.<br>
